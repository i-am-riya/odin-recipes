    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cholay is a very flavorful recipe from North India, usually eaten with fried bread like bhatura or puri. I like to serve it over rice for a very filling meal. You can also try it as a quick snack over toasted bread. This recipe is much quicker to make if you use precooked canned beans, but I like to think that the authentic flavor comes from doing it the hard way!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Place 2 cups water, tea bag, and bay leaf into a pot and bring water to a boil. Reserving about 1/2 cup garbanzo beans, stir beans into boiling water. When beans are heated through, discard tea bag and bay leaf. Remove from heat. Drain beans, reserving water, and set aside. </li>
        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet over medium heat and saut√© sliced onion until tender. Remove from heat, cool, and mix in reserved garbanzo beans, 1 tomato, and 1/2 the cilantro leaves. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in a skillet over medium heat. Blend in coriander, cumin seeds, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir for 15 to 20 seconds, until lightly browned. Mix in turmeric. Stir chopped onion into the skillet and cook until tender. Mix in remaining tomatoes. Season with salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala. Bring tomato liquid to a boil and cook about 5 minutes. Stir in boiled garbanzo beans, sliced onion mixture, and enough of the reserved water to attain a thick, gravy-like consistency. Continue to cook and stir 5 minutes. Garnish with remaining cilantro leaves to serve. </li>
